### Measure power

- Monetary contribution to the system, degraded over time.
- Physical presence in the system, possibly based on physical traits such as whether you're an adult.

Once we know how to measure power, we can implement an electoral system. The outer governmental system can create governmental subregions, and can optional instantiate electoral systems in these regions as well, and so forth.


###

A region is any area enclosed by a border with no gaps in it. Regions are organized using a hierarchy, with the top region being the entire planet.

A region that's not at the top will have a parent. Regions can decide to switch parent, if that region is on the border between the new and old parent, and if the new parent accepts.

A region can decide to split into two, or two adjacent regions can decide to merge into one. A region can also decide to create several child regions within itself.

###

There are many activities which require working together, and these activities are most easily implemented if everyone part of a certain physical region is forced to contribute to them. Think of a justice system and its enforcement, infrastructural changes, environmental policy, etc.

We expect that naturally certain bordered regions are formed, let's call them countries, where each country has found some means to allow it to uphold its governmental system and laws within its border.

Countries need a certain mass, since they need economies of scale to be able to maintain sufficient economic and military power to maintain their borders.

There are also factors that prevent countries from becoming larger. There might be geographical factors that make it difficult to exert military power across a certain region, due to land or water masses, or there might be cultural differences across regions that make it inefficient to cooperate on societal endeavors, such as differences in the desired justice system, or differences in economic ability to contribute to infrastructure projects.

###

There is a representational government at each level. Each subregion provides a representative (or can they provide multiple?) through its election process. Each representative gets voting power based on the properties of their subregion.

### What gets decided at which level?

The top level can make all decisions, but since its government is made up from representatives provided by the subregions, there is an inclination to push decisions down to subregions whenever possible.

### What determines the right size for regions?
 

## Pyramid

### Outer
- Environmental policy
  - Global warming
  - Biodiversity
- Military
- Law enforcement
- Global infrastructure
  - Panama/Suez canal
  - Everything in orbit

### Middle
- Mid-level Infrastructure
  - Bridge
  - Highway 

### Lower
- Residential and work permit
- Justice system
- Services
  - Education
  - Fire department
  - Social welfare
  - Healthcare

Do we need an outer level language?
