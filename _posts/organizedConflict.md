# Core mechanics

## Spawning

We can't have particular safe havens where people spawn, because we don't want safe havens.

We don't want people to spawn in random places, because that can cause chaos.

We don't want people to spawn in predictable places, because that leaves them vulnerable.

Spawning players near other players that want to spawn them seems OK. Players can spawn by asking another player to spawn them, which will give the hosting player a little mana. Possibly the host needs to perform a casting ritual. The first player would spawn at a particular holy location on the map. Problem is how do you figure out who wants to spawn you. Maybe the game will actively invite players to spawn others when there is a need.

Another option is for there to be many spawn locations, and allowing the player to pick which one they want to use. There would have to be a TON of these locations, so they can not possibly all be camped. This option puts too many restrictions on the map.

## Despawning
When players leave the game, we have to decide what happens to the character. Instantly letting the character disappear into safety wouldn't be fun. We propose a number of different mechanisms: 

Let the character turn into a pocket sized cube. This way an ally can pick up and carry the player, and keep them safe while the player is offline. 

The player decides to hide at his current location. Either he burrows into the ground or shifts into a nether realm. If another player sort of knows where the hiding location is, then he can uncover the hidden player and kill them, so when hiding better make sure nobody knows where you are. 

Cast a lengthy despawning ritual.

## Quests

### Transport

There's a source and a destination. An delivery can be bought at the source for X, and sold at the destination more than X. However, between the source and destination, there are also other location where the delivery can be sold for less than X.




Important in the real world is that a human life is valuable. It takes a lot to create an adult human, so killing one is a big net loss for the world. In games, often killing a player is not a net loss, since the player respawns again, although sometimes with a slight delay. We think it is important to make a player dying have a net loss, and not in the way that just the player loses XP, because that loss would only matter to the player, but in a way that when a player is killed, others can benefit less from this player. 

 

To fix this, we will let players automatically generate value, where the speed of the generation is based on how long they've been alive. There is an upper limit to the generation speed, and by tweaking the time it takes to get to this upper limit we can influence how often players get killed. If the time to get to the upper limit is very long, players will play more carefully, and players will protect each other, to make sure that nobody dies. Maybe letting the max generation happen after a week is a good compromise. 

 
 

What happens when a player is killed? This should not generate any net value, there should simply be a transfer of value and the resetting of the killed player's value generation. 

 

How does a player become stronger? Ideally through social progression. However, normally social progression happens in a very complicate way. For example the COE of a company like Microsoft might have a long history which makes him suitable for the role, but no such complicated roles exist within the game. Maybe we can let players accrue some form of knowledge over time, or some form of power, that slowly leaks away but that they can use to maintain their power. 

 

Social powers: 

Slightly buff/debuff a large group of players. You could get this ability through a limited use staff. 

View a particular location on the map, allowing you to spy on other players. Ability to get a binoculars. 

See where particular quests/value gaining opportunities have spawned. 

Create a teleportation device. Probably limited by mass going through. 

Construct transportation devices that require multiple operators, such as a wagon for transporting large minerals. 

Locate other players 

Spawn quests. 

 

There is a certain amount of mana flowing into the world, and this allows for only a limited number of spells to be cast. High tier spells can only be cast by those who manage to gain the most mana. The tier of a spell determines how many other players it is able to affect. 

 

I don't think physical strength should be able to increase almost unboundedly. There may be some stats like fitness/strength/agility that increase through exercise, but that can also slowly expire. Then there are things like equipment, which also doesn't like forever, and there is a limit to how powerful equipment can become. 

 

Two players, where one is trying to fight the other, should always be able to have an interesting interaction. The weaker player should still be able to damage his attacker, or simply waste the attacker's time, and if he does well enough, his attacker might give up. 

 

Types of ways to get value. 

A meteor drops down, which can be seen from afar, and the value from it can be picked up from the ground. 

Something akin to the traveling salesman problem. Given a list of locations, go to all of them (within a certain time limit?) 

Maybe something akin to a shooter? Shoot moving targets. This quest just spawns in certain environments. Go to those to find it. 

An item must be transported from one location to another. Can become a very big item that requires special equipment to transport. 

Find a specific item.  

Follow a riddle (some type of directions to a treasure chest location). You might have to do things that make it obvious to other players that you are finding a treasure chest. 

Fight some computer controlled monster.
